Pruned version of EMOOPIC

To build, type:

>make

Some of these make options need the intel compilers.  Individual options are

>make EMOOPIC
>make EMOOPIC_PIC
>make EMOOPIC_VEC
>make EMOOPIC_PIC_VEC

The last two requiring the Intel compilers.  Included in the src directory is a script doit.sh that
runs all test cases used in the report, and outputs various .dat files containing the timing of
various routines. These .dat files have headers which explains the meaning of every column.


To run EMOOPIC(_VEC), type

>EMOOPIC <filename> <deposition flag> <sorting flag>

The file input.txt is included in the src direction. This contains the test problem uses in the report. 
The deposition flag can be either

0 - Standard deposition
1 - Deposition proposed by Vincenti et al. 2016

The sorting flag can be either

0 - Quicksork
1 - Counting Sort (much faster)

Arguments are similar for EMOOPIC_PIC, though the sorting flag is not used.

FIXES
- better performance on Boris Push
- UpdateCell cost cancelled by Boundary savings
- Numerous loop vectorizations (e.g., std::vector<>.size())
